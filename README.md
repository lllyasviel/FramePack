# **goan: A Power-User UI for FramePack**

[!IMPORTANT]
An absolute must-read before even touching goan is the official FramePack documentation, as it contains critical scripts and instructions for setting up the correct environment, as well as beautiful examples just from the most basic controls: https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack

Welcome to goan, an enhanced user interface designed for creative professionals and power users of FramePack. This project builds upon the brilliant FramePack video generation engine created by lllyasviel (of Fooocus and the Stable Diffusion Forge fork of A1111), exposing useful controls to reach further into FramePack's functionality through a robust and intuitive interface.

The base FramePack provides a powerful core model. goan extends it with a suite of tools designed for serious workflow, experimentation, and reproducibility. Unlock fine-grained control over your video generations with batch processing, parameter editing, effortless recipe sharing by dropping a PNG with goan metadata into the UI, and complete workspace management.

### **Key Features for a Creative Workflow**

The features in goan are designed to directly support two important aspects for any serious use of FramePack: deep control over the diffusion process and improved long-term connections for long-running jobs.

* **Optimized Preview Generation:**
    * **Selective MP4 Previews:** Control when VAE-decoded MP4 previews are generated (via "Preview Frequency" and "Preview Segments CSV"), significantly reducing unnecessary compute and speeding up generation. The "Preview Frequency" now correctly applies to segments generated within the main loop (starting from Segment 1).
* **Expanded GPU Compatibility:** `goan` now enables FramePack to run on a wider range of NVIDIA GPUs, including **pre-Ampere cards** (SM75 and below rated devices), which were previously restricted. This greatly expands accessibility for users with older hardware.
* **Improved Session Management & Resilience:** Long-running jobs are the norm for video generation, and nothing is more frustrating than a UI disconnect interrupting hours of progress.
    * **Backend-Driven State Persistence:** The entire state of your session—the task queue, processing status, and live updates—is managed persistently on the backend. This means your job keeps running safely on the server, completely independent of the browser tab's status (minimized, screen locked, etc.).
    * **Task Queue & UI State Crash Recovery:** Beyond network stability, the entire task queue can be saved manually and is automatically saved to disk when the application exits. This queue is reloaded on startup. If there's a system crash or you need to restart, you can simply relaunch `goan`, and your queue will be right where you left it, ready to continue processing.
* **Effortless "Recipe" Sharing and Management:** `goan` provides a robust, stateful image input system for managing creative parameters.
    * **Drop-in Parameter Loading:** You can take a PNG generated by `goan`, drop it into the input area, and the UI will automatically detect the embedded settings. A modal dialog will appear, showing you a preview of the prompt from the image's metadata and asking if you want to apply the settings. This makes sharing and reusing "recipes" effortless and transparent.
    * **Download Image with Current Metadata:** The "Download" button that appears with a loaded image allows you to save a new copy of the image at any time. This new PNG will be embedded with the *current* creative settings from the UI, making it a perfect, portable snapshot of your work-in-progress. This image is also written with the first segment of any video so you don't have to remember to grab it manually.
* **Complete Workspace Management:**
    * **Full UI State Save/Load:** For more complex projects, you can save your *entire UI state*—all sliders, text boxes, and checkboxes—to a single `.json` file. This "workspace" can be reloaded at any time, which is invaluable for complex projects or for ensuring consistent settings across sessions.
    * **Full Task Queue Control:** `goan` includes a full-featured task queue where you can add, remove, reorder, and *edit* jobs before or even during the task processing.
* **Advanced Diffusion Controls:**
    * **Variable CFG:** Introduces the ability to adjust the "Distilled CFG Scale" during generation, offering artistic control over prompt adherence as the video evolves. This can be used to correct for a tendency for FramePack to "burn in" or oversaturate the final video as total length increases, giving you greater artistic control. [!Any effect from this is still being tested.]

#### **Diffusion Controls Tips (CFG, Guidance Scale)**
* **Note:** These setting suggestions are based on producing still images. Their effects on FramePack videos are still being discovered.)

**Understanding CFG:** Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a critical technique in diffusion models. Think of it as a knob that controls how strongly the model should adhere to your text prompt versus how much creative freedom it has.

* A **low CFG** value allows the model to be more imaginative, potentially straying from the prompt.
* A **high CFG** value forces the model to follow the prompt more strictly, which can cause significant contrast burn when set too high, particularly as the duration of your video increases.

In this model, there are two main guidance controls exposed:

* **Distilled CFG:** This is the primary control you will use.
    * Start with 10.
    * If bright colors contrast too harshly, experiment with levels around 7-9.
    * Variable CFG has been added but useful suggestions here are still pending.
* **Real CFG:** This controls the standard guidance, which is essential for negative prompts.
    * **Important:** For your **Negative Prompt** to have any effect, you must set the CFG Scale to a value greater than 1.0 (e.g., 1.1 or 2.0).
    * **Performance Trade-Off:** Be aware that setting CFG Scale to any value other than 1.0 will roughly **double the generation time** for your video, as it requires a second pass for each step. Use it only when you need the control of a negative prompt.

#### **New Functionality: Workspace & Metadata**

This entire feature set is new in `goan` to extend power user functionality to FramePack.

* **Drop-in Parameter Loading:** This is the core of the new workflow. You can take a PNG generated by `goan`, drop it into the image input, and the UI will automatically detect the embedded settings. For each image, you are presented the prompt and the option of applying the image's settings. This makes sharing and reusing "recipes" via the base images themselves effortless.
* **Workspace Management:** Users can now save the *entire state* of the UI—all sliders, text boxes, and checkboxes—to a `.json` file. This "workspace" can be reloaded at any time, which is invaluable for complex projects or for ensuring consistent settings across sessions.
* **Session Persistence & Autosave:** The task queue is automatically saved when the application is closed and reloaded on startup. This prevents the loss of a long list of batched jobs. The UI also successfully restores its last state after a page refresh, ensuring continuous live progress updates.
* **Full Task Queue Control:** `goan` includes a full-featured task queue where you can add, remove, reorder, and *edit* jobs before or even during the task processing.

### **Installation**

goan is designed to run from a cloned repository with its Python dependencies managed via pip. Before running, ensure you have the necessary system-level dependencies.

* **PyTorch and CUDA:** A compatible version of PyTorch and the CUDA Toolkit is required. This project was developed and tested on **PyTorch 2.7.0+cu128**. It should be compatible with other PyTorch 2.x versions, but this has not been tested. Your specific version will depend on your GPU and drivers. You can find installation scripts and documentation at https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack.
